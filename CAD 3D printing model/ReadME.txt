Taj Mahal 3D Model

Overview
This project includes all necessary files for the 3D printing of a Taj Mahal model. The model is designed to be printed in two separate parts, the top and the bottom, allowing the final structure to remain hollow inside for optimal material usage and structural integrity.

Files Included
CAD Model (Solid Edge)

Contains a Solid Edge part document necessary for accurate design and visualization of the Taj Mahal.
G-Code File

The most widely used programming language in CNC and 3D printing, this file contains the instructions for machine operations.
STL File

Includes logs and STL documents for both parts of the Taj Mahal:
Top part
Bottom part

Printing Instructions

Preparation:
Ensure your 3D printer is properly calibrated.
Load the CAD model into your preferred 3D modeling software to review the design.

G-Code Generation:
Use the provided G-code file for programming your 3D printer.

Printing:
Print the Taj Mahal in two separate parts: the bottom part and the top part.
Verify each part’s integrity before assembling.

Assembly:
Once both parts are printed, carefully assemble the top and bottom parts.
Ensure that the connection is secure to maintain the structure’s integrity.

Conclusion:
The model is designed to be hollow to optimize material usage.
Make the necessary size changes according to the time required to print the model.
